# Problem Descirption
Prompt:  Pretend you are the owner/operator of a tennis (or football, soccer - your choice) club needing to build a relational database. You hired some students from the MIST 4610 class at the University of Georgia to create the database for you. They need to know more about your organization to identify which entities, attributes, and relationships are important for you. Start by describing your business as a real client.
