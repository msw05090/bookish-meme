# Problem Description
Prompt:  Pretend you are the owner/operator of a tennis (or football, soccer - your choice) club needing to build a relational database. You hired some students from the MIST 4610 class at the University of Georgia to create the database for you. They need to know more about your organization to identify which entities, attributes, and relationships are important for you. Start by describing your business as a real client.

# Data Model
Our model has a diverse membership base consisting of individuals of all ages, skill levels, and backgrounds. Our club hosts regular tournaments for recreational and competitive matches. Additionally, we offer coaching programs led by certified instructors to help our members improve their skills and reach their full potential on the court.
In terms of operations, we manage court reservations, membership registrations, coaching schedules, tournament logistics, and facility maintenance. We rely on efficient organization and communication to ensure smooth functioning and deliver a positive experience for our members.
